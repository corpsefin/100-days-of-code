# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 01, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued to make my ElectronJS Pomodoro App, playing around with string functions. making addeventlistener function so that I don't have to make six different eventlistener functions for each button. Probably the 'hard way' of doing things, but I want to make things the way I haven't done ever before.

**Thoughts:** HTML input type 'time' uses strings as value apparently, got the venetlistener thing to work, it's ugly af but it works like I planned. Struggling bit with the logic of making the break timer.

### Day 2: March 02, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Timer logic with short and long breaks, it is almost ready, needs bit of tweaking.

**Thoughts:** Bit rough day with brainfog and fighting against procrastination.

### Day 3: March 03, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Tried to make function to delete the timers and came to a conclusion that I'll have to make the whole timer rendering again and also the whole timer..

**Thoughts:** Frustrating..

### Day 4: March 04, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Apparently I didn't know how to use setInterval and clearInterval.. so I had to learn more about those.

**Thoughts:** Going steps back is always frustrating, also bit too tired to day for programming.

### Day 5: March 05, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started making the Pomodoro timer from the start, fighting with the logic of the timer..

**Thoughts:** Seems like I haven't learned the most basic logical thinking and it's what makes this project hard and keeps me feeling unmotivated.

### Day 7: March 07, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Got the timer done, couple of thing still to be done, but the most important timer logic is done!

**Thoughts:** Feels good to get something done, this whole week has been a rollercoaster with motivation and fighting with procrastination. The most challenging thing for me is keeping myself away from procrastination.. that's the goal for the next week!
