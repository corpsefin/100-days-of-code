# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 01, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued to make my ElectronJS Pomodoro App, playing around with string functions. making addeventlistener function so that I don't have to make six different eventlistener functions for each button. Probably the 'hard way' of doing things, but I want to make things the way I haven't done ever before.

**Thoughts:** HTML input type 'time' uses strings as value apparently, got the venetlistener thing to work, it's ugly af but it works like I planned. Struggling bit with the logic of making the break timer, but hey, struggling helps.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
